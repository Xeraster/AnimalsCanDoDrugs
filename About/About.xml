	<description>Tired of your cats drinking your beer all day but not touching the yayo because "they don't do drugs"? What a bunch of hypocrites. This mod makes it so that cats can eat certain drugs the same way they drink booze. Additionally, prisoners will now eat drugs rather than starve themselves to death if there are drugs available but no other food. You can allow or dissallow certain drugs to be autonomously eaten by either drugs or prisoners by unchecking them in the mod settings menu. Requires harmony.</description>
