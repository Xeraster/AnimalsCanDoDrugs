# AnimalsCanDoDrugs
A mod that allows animals in Rimworld to antonomously do drugs other than booze

Tired of your pets drinking your beer all day but not touching the yayo because "they don't do drugs"? What a bunch of hypocrites. This mod makes it so that animals can eat drugs the same way they drink booze. Now your cats can be high AND drunk instead of just drunk. Additionally, prisoners will now do drugs rather than starve themselves to death if there are drugs available but no other food.

You can allow or disallow certain drugs to be autonomously eaten by animals and prisoners by unchecking them in the mod settings menu. You do NOT need to reload the game after changing any of that stuff.

It also has optional (and disabled by default) settings to allow prisoners a recreation needs bar as well as elevating booze and drugs to be at the same priority as normal food. Don't enable the latter option as it makes pawns do really stupid things. I only left it in because it's funny. Please note that if you change any of those 2 options, you will need to restart the game in order for the changes to take effect.

The default settings in the mod configuration menu are probably optimal for most people. It has recommended default settings for rimcuisine 2 drugs, the forbidden mod, rim genetics, rimatomics and the poop mod.

Note that any mod (other than rimcuisine 2 alcohol) that completely overhauls either the alcohol system or the drug system (by overriding base defs) will most likely NOT be compatible with this. If there is enough demand, I may implement specific code to handle other mods that are being "incompatible" due to lots of def changes.

Requires harmony. This mod is compatible with Rimcuisine 2's booze addon. It will work correctly whether or not you're running that mod. While mod loading order doesn't seem to make a difference, I recommend putting this somewhere in the bottom quarter of the mod list.
